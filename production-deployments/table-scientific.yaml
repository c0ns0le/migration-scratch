          - `Realtime.springer.com <http://realtime.springer.com/>`_
            is a service that aggregates together downloads of Springer
            journal articles and book chapters in real time and displays
            them in a variety of visualizations. The goal of this
            service is to provide the scientific community with valuable
            information about how the literature is being used 'right
            now'. MongoDB is used to store the details of one million
            downloads per day from across Springer's sites. Map reduce
            jobs generate collections for the last 7, 30, and 90 days
            for around 2,000 journal and 40,000 book titles.

          `eZuce <https://www.ezuce.com/>`_ openUC features an
          advanced SIP Services Oriented Architecture (SSOA) which
          uses MongoDB to persistently store all user profile and
          transaction data in a distributed way. While MongoDB's
          stellar performance is critical to SSOA, its main benefit
          for SSOA is the horizontal sharding that's part of its
          architecture, which allows horizontal scaling across several
          nodes. MongoDB also holds all client registration data and
          makes it available to all session manager nodes. The effect
          to the user is completely seamless failover at a regional or
          global level. Many session manager nodes can participate in
          such a globally redundant cluster, which allows enterprises
          to easily build a robust communications backbone that spans
          the entire enterprise.
