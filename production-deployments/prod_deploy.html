They have indexed (and stored with GridFS) over 300,000 documents (56GB) into a single Mongo database. Mongo is much easier to get online than a comparable RDBMS, and the rich feature set helped significantly reduce the amount of required application coding. All said and done, switching to Mongo for this project has been a big win.</td>

<td class="content.Sailthru%2"> <a href="http://www.sailthru.com/">Sailthru</a> is an innovative email service provider that focuses on improving the quality of emails over quantity. Moving to MongoDB from MySQL allowed us extreme flexibility in providing an API to our clients. Passing in arbitrary JSON data is easy our customers can use objects and arrays inside of their emails. And we've launched Sailthru Alerts, which allows our customers basically whitelabeled Google Alerts: realtime and summary alerts (price, tag match, etc) that are completely up to the customer due to our schema-free data storage. Also, we can gather realtime behavioral data on a client's signed-up users (tag-based interests, geolocale, time of day, etc), and use all that information to power dynamically assembled mass emails that get higher click-through rates than static emails. Plus we just launched an onsite recommendation widget (check it out at refinery29.com), and we're using MongoDB's analytic capabilities to rapidly A/B test different behavioral algorithms.

One of the changes that Forbes has undertaken starting in 2010 was the opening up of its digital and print platforms to a global collection of content creators, marketers and audience members. This necessitated the changing of how the site worked, allowing content to flow easily through the site. Forbes began to evaluate how they store and serve their content and decided to use MongoDB. They are currently using MongoDB for storing articles and companies data and are working to move more of their core assets onto it.

In one glance, Trello tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process. Trello stores all historical and non-ephemeral data in MongoDB. The Trello team was attracted to MongoDB for its speed. MongoDB offers very fast writes, faster reads, and better denormalization support; it allows them to store the data of each individual card on the Trello board in a single document in the database and still have the ability to query into (and index) subfields of the document. They were also attracted to MongoDB's reliability: it is really easy to replicate, back up, and restore.<br>
Other benefits for the Trello team: using a loose document store makes it easy to run different versions of the Trello code against the same database without fooling around with DB schema migrations. This has a lot of benefits when they push a new version of Trello; there is seldom (if ever) a need to stop access to the app while we do a DB update or backfill.

MongoDB also holds all client registration data and makes it available to all session manager nodes. The effect to the user is completely seamless failover at a regional or global level. Many session manager nodes can participate in such a globally redundant cluster, which allows enterprises to easily build a robust communications backbone that spans the entire enterprise.</td>

When a API call is received we send that query to MongoDB which performs the search and returns the primary key id's of the properties matching the query. Those id's are then looked up in MySQL using the primary key returned from MongoDB. Once we have the full result set the results are served up and passed back to the client as either XML or JSON. When a Property is updated either via the Web or external the external python importers (not shown) then the id of the property is stored in a Redis/Resque queue and a worker fired to synchronize the MongoDB with the changes. All this means that on average API query results are returned in ~100 milliseconds.

Second, we are using MongoDB to hold a set of summary documents to help us calculate a series of statistics for our Email and SMS subscription lists.

We evaluated CouchDB, Mongo and Google App Engine and Mongo made it possible to do exactly what we needed. The database is now up and running; we're just rolling out sets and soon we should have some flows up and running, too.</td>
