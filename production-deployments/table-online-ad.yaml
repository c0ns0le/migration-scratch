          MongoDB will be the central data store in Magnetic's system,
          providing low-latency, high-volume reads in a distributed
          cluster behind its pixel servers, and near-real-time
          aggregate counts to its clients for forecasting. Magnetic is
          excited by the speed, replication features, flexible data
          model, and map-reduce style query access, which will let it
          dramatically simplify its system relative to the current
          architecture using a key-value store.
