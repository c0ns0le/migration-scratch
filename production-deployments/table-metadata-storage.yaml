          `Lulu's <http://www.lulu.com/>`_ open publishing platform
          empowers more creators to sell more content to more readers
          more profitably than ever before. Lulu uses MongoDB to store
          the bibliographic, product, and file metadata for its
          creators' works. MongoDB's document-based data model makes
          it easy to manage the differences between print books,
          eBooks, photo books, and calendars and to keep up with the
          rapidly evolving world of self publishing.

          `3DRepo.org <http://3DRepo.org/>`_ uses MongoDB as a domain
          specific repository to store scene graph components as well
          as associated non-linear revision history of 3D assets. The
          main reasons for choosing MongoDB over alternative NoSQL
          solutions is the use of BSON documents for storage and
          retrieval, automated sharding, MapReduce functionality and
          built-in support for geospatial indexing.
