          At `CustomInk <http://www.customink.com/>`_, we believe
          custom t-shirts have the power to turn your group into a
          team, elevate your gathering to an event, or make your
          special moment more... well, momentous. That's why we make
          it easy to create awesome shirts. CustomInk uses MongoDB for
          a number of different applications including:

          - Supply Chain Management - MongoDB stores information about
            t-shirt suppliers and local screen printers.

          - Content Management - MongoDB is used to store the `product
            catalog <http://www.customink.com/categories/>`_, CustomInk
            sells hundreds of products, not just t-shrits.

          - Logging - MongoDB is used for logging interactions on the
            website and as a central store for application
            logs. Learn more about how CustomInk is using MongoDB
            from their `presentation given at MongoSV 2011
