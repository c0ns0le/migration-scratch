          `Santosoft <http://www.santosoft.com/>`_ uses MongoDB for
          virtually 100_ of its data related stack. They run a fully
          blown shard cluster for transactional data, as well as
          analytics. They are building apps and tools for MongoDB and
          also hope to build the largest common care database
          globally.

          `HolaDoctor.com <http://holadoctor.com/es/>`_ is the most
          comprehensive health and wellness portal available in
          Spanish for the global online Hispanic community. MongoDB is
          being used to store all the content for the site, including
          GridFS to store article images. Session data is also being
          persisted on our MongoDB cluster using a custom PHP save
          handler.

          `Vitals.com <http://vitals.com>`_ consolidates and
          standardizes doctor and other health provider data from over
          1,000 sources to help users make informed health care
          choices. Our technology also powers the websites and
          backends of insurance companies, hospitals, and other health
          information brokers. In early October, we switched the
          datasource for our Find A Doctor location-based search
          functionality from PostgreSQL to a geo-indexed MongoDB
          collection. Since then, searches are now five to ten times
          as fast, and the decreased load on our dataservers permits
          us to serve more clients. Based on this success, we are
          transitioning other functionality to MongoDB datasources.

          `TalkAboutHealth <http://talkabouthealth.com>`_ matches
          people with similar health concerns for answers and live
          chats. Meet others just like you, learn from experienced
          peers, and share your experiences.

          `Earlydoc <http://www.earlydoc.com/>`_ models medical data,
          which means things like master-identity management and data
          normalization occupy a lot of development time: this,
          specificly, is where the schemaless design of MongoDB is
          a<b>huge</b> win.

          `D Sharp <http://cdn2.dsharpdiabetes.com/>`_ uses MongoDB to
          store detailed medical observations and perform complex
          analysis to help people with diabetes better manage their
          blood sugars. Built using the Express web framework for
          Node.js and JQuery Mobile, D Sharp is the only diabetes
          application that support all types of diabetes on any modern
          smartphone or browser. This includes iPhone, iPad, Android,
          Windows Mobile, Blackberry and desktop browsers.

          `Vigilant Medical <http://vigilantmedical.net>`_ uses
          MongoDB to manage the large, complex, and often sparse
          metadata surrounding medical images. MongoDB also provides
          the entire administrative backbone of Vigilant's enterprise
          web application, ImageShare.

          `Mini Medical Record <https://minimedrec.com/mmr.php>`_ is
          designed to improve medical care. While designed to help
          everyone, it is especially useful for travelers, and others
          who may receive care through multiple medical systems.
          Whether paper or electronic, medical records in cutting edge
          hospitals are often geared more for billing and medicolegal
          protection. Critical up-to-date information may be very
          challenging to discover. In addition, even simple
          information like emergency contact phone numbers and latest
          medication lists, may be inaccessible for patients who seek
          care in settings where they do not routinely receive their
          care. Mini Medical Record alleviates those issues.
