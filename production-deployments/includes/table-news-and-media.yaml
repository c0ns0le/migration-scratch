          Guardian.co.uk is a leading UK-based news website. They've
          spent ten years fighting relational database representations
          of our domain model, until the implementation of our API
          made us realize that if only we could store documents
          everything would be simpler. MongoDB is a key part of the
          Guardian's infrastructure.

          `Examiner.com <http://www.examiner.com>`_ is the fastest-
          growing local content network in the U.S., powered by the
          largest pool of knowledgeable and passionate contributors in
          the world. Launched in April 2008 with 60 cities,
          Examiner.com now serves hundreds of markets across the U.S.
          and Canada.   Examiner.com migrated their site from Cold
          Fusion and SQL Server to Drupal 7 and MongoDB. Details of
          the deployment are outlined in an `Acquia case study

          `Business Insider <http://www.businessinsider.com/how-we-

          beginning of 2008. All of the site's data, including posts,
          comments, and even the images, are stored on MongoDB. For
          more information:

          `Forbes <http://www.10gen.com/customers/forbes>`_ has been
          around for nearly 100 years and on the web for more than a
          decade; recently, the media space has been a changing
          landscape. One of the changes that Forbes has undertaken
          starting in 2010 was the opening up of its digital and print
          platforms to a global collection of content creators,
          marketers and audience members. This necessitated the
          changing of how the site worked, allowing content to flow
          easily through the site. Forbes began to evaluate how they
          store and serve their content and decided to use MongoDB.
          They are currently using MongoDB for storing articles and
          companies data and are working to move more of their core
          assets onto it.

          Report Cards application
          <http://schools.chicagotribune.com/>`_, which is generated
          from a nearly 9,000 column denormalized database dump
          produced annually by the State Board of Education. The
          application allows readers to search by school name, city,
          county, or district and to view demographic, economic, and
          performance data for both schools and districts.
