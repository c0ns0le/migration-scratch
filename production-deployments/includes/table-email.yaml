          `Sailthru <http://www.sailthru.com/>`_ is an innovative
          email service provider that focuses on improving the quality
          of emails over quantity. Moving to MongoDB from MySQL
          allowed us extreme flexibility in providing an API to our
          clients. Passing in arbitrary JSON data is easy our
          customers can use objects and arrays inside of their emails.
          And we've launched Sailthru Alerts, which allows our
          customers basically whitelabeled Google Alerts: realtime and
          summary alerts (price, tag match, etc) that are completely
          up to the customer due to our schema-free data storage.
          Also, we can gather realtime behavioral data on a client's
          signed-up users (tag-based interests, geolocale, time of
          day, etc), and use all that information to power dynamically
          assembled mass emails that get higher click-through rates
          than static emails. Plus we just launched an onsite
          recommendation widget (check it out at refinery29.com), and
          we're using MongoDB's analytic capabilities to rapidly A/B
          test different behavioral algorithms.

          `fiesta.cc <https://fiesta.cc/>`_ makes creating mailing
          lists dead-simple, and fun. The goal is to bring groups
          together around a tool that everybody already uses and
          understands: email. We use MongoDB to store all of the data
          powering the website and the mail serving infrastructure.
          We're running a three node replica set.
