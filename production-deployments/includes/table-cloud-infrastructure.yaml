          `Firebase <http://www.firebase.com/>`_ is a cloud service
          that automatically synchronizes data between clients and
          cloud servers. Apps built with Firebase can be written
          entirely with client-side JavaScript, update in real-time
          out-of-the-box, are inherently scalable, and interoperate
          well with existing services. Firebase offers developers a
          massively scaleable real-time backend for web applications.
          Firebase stores all its data in MongoDB which offers the
          built-in capability for apps to scale automatically and
          gives each piece of data its own unique URL stored in JSON
          documents.
