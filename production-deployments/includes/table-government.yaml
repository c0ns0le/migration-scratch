          The British Government launched a beta of its GOV.UK
          platform, testing a single domain for that could be used
          throughout government. According to James Stewart, the Tech
          Lead on the beta of GOV.UK, 'We started out building
          everything using MySQL but moved to MongoDB as we realised
          how much of our content fitted its document-centric
          approach,' said Stewart. 'Over time we've been more and more
          impressed with it and expect to increase our usage of it in
          the future.'
