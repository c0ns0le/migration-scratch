          - `Realtime.springer.com <http://realtime.springer.com/>`_
            is a service that aggregates together downloads of Springer
            journal articles and book chapters in real time and displays
            them in a variety of visualizations. The goal of this
            service is to provide the scientific community with valuable
            information about how the literature is being used 'right
            now'. MongoDB is used to store the details of one million
            downloads per day from across Springer's sites. Map reduce
            jobs generate collections for the last 7, 30, and 90 days
            for around 2,000 journal and 40,000 book titles.
