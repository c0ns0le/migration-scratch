          LearnBoost is a free and amazing `gradebook
          <http://www.learnboost.com/>`_ web app that leverages
          MongoDB for its data storage needs. LearnBoost is the
          creator of `Mongoose <http://github.com/learnboost>`_, a
          JavaScript async ORM for MongoDB that is flexible,
          extensible and simple to use.

          `Foothill-De Anza Community College District
          <http://www.fhda.edu/>`_ migrated a problematic document
          storage system into a web application backed by MongoDB, and
          using the Mongo GORM plug-in for Grails. They have indexed
          (and stored with GridFS) over 300,000 documents (56GB) into
          a single Mongo database. Mongo is much easier to get online
          than a comparable RDBMS, and the rich feature set helped
          significantly reduce the amount of required application
          coding. All said and done, switching to Mongo for this
          project has been a big win.
