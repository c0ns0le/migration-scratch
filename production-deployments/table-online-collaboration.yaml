          `Trello <http://trello.com>`_ is a collaboration tool that
          organizes your projects into boards. In one glance, Trello
          tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and
          where something is in a process. Trello stores all
          historical and non-ephemeral data in MongoDB. The Trello
          team was attracted to MongoDB for its speed. MongoDB offers
          very fast writes, faster reads, and better denormalization
          support; it allows them to store the data of each individual
          card on the Trello board in a single document in the
          database and still have the ability to query into (and
          index) subfields of the document. They were also attracted
          to MongoDB's reliability: it is really easy to replicate,
          back up, and restore. Other benefits for the Trello team:
          using a loose document store makes it easy to run different
          versions of the Trello code against the same database
          without fooling around with DB schema migrations. This has a
          lot of benefits when they push a new version of Trello;
          there is seldom (if ever) a need to stop access to the app
          while we do a DB update or backfill.
