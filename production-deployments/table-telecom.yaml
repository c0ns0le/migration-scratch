          `Viber Media <http://www.viber.com/>`_ is using MongoDB as
          the core cloud infrastructure for its popular iPhone and
          Android applications that offer free phone calls and text
          messaging between users over 3G and wireless networks. Viber
          selected MongoDB for its ability to scale as more users join
          the Viber community and to manage peak and unpredictable
          data loads from its 30 million plus registered mobile users.
