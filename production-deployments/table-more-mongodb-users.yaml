          the primary key id's of the properties matching the query.
          Those id's are then looked up in MySQL using the primary key
          returned from MongoDB. Once we have the full result set the
          results are served up and passed back to the client as
          either XML or JSON. When a Property is updated either via
          the Web or external the external python importers (not
          shown) then the id of the property is stored in a
          Redis/Resque queue and a worker fired to synchronize the
          MongoDB with the changes. All this means that on average API
          query results are returned in ~100 milliseconds.

          the consumer never-before convenience in various kinds of

          biggest problems faced by the common man is the hassle of
          dealing with large public and private enterprises for bill
          payment services. In the last decade, the consumer base of
          several industries has grown exponentially, though the
          support services have not been able to keep pace. We use

          generated reports. We have chosen MongoDB most because of
          its simplicity, specially to shard the collections. Shards
          are very important for us since we collect and analyze a lot

          `Intelie <http://www.intelie.com/>`_ is a software that
          receives data from several sources and, using Complex Event
          Processing (CEP) and machine learning techniques, makes it
          possible to detect anomalies and known problems on data
          centers in real time. We use MongoDB to store all the data
          that IEM analyses over time, about 5000 documents per minute
          for one company. Storing these events allow us to 'replay'
          past scenarios to test new rules, in addition to providing
          dashboards and charts of historical data.

          First, we are using MongoDB's geospatial queries to power
          location based marketing campaigns. Our users can create a
          SMS marketing campaign to ask users for their zip code in
          reply to an SMS message, perform a lookup of known locations
          (stores) based on that zip code, and return the nearest
          location to the user. Second, we are using MongoDB to hold a
          set of summary documents to help us calculate a series of
          statistics for our Email and SMS subscription lists. Instead
          of gathering these statistics by running SQL queries in
          tables with excess of 10 million rows, we're able to get the
          same numbers by looking at anywhere from 30 - 365 summary
          documents. As you can imagine, this dramatically speeds up
          these queries. This use case is documented at

          input) and SQL techniques (EAV) but found the all
          frustrating to swapped to no-sql style DBs. We evaluated

          first being a service layer that parses twitter pushes
          results into a queue style mongo collection (not sharded
          yet, but will be as we grow it) where a separate thread will
          then pops off the top elements and parse these
          results/resize images/and pushes into our media collection.
          The second part is web layer which grabs media from a Mongo
          collection indexed by hashtag, re-aggregates them in memory,
          and sends them to the view. The speed and flexibility of
          Mongo was great in helping us spin out the bulk of this idea

          aggregator that crawls the web and uses an intelligent
          system to automatically find products and deals. The
          challenge with traditional DBMS was to store entities with
          different properties. With MongoDB, entities are stored as
          documents. Also, with MongoDB expansion problems across our
          servers have been solved. Sidebuy crawls thousands of
          webpages per day and store everything in BSON documents now.
          Geospatial querying is also a big plus for Sidebuy.com.

          replica set configuration spanning multiple data centers.
          MongoDB drives the Node.js web application and houses both
          the main data store and analytics data store. The
          flexibility and resiliency of the platform, combined with
          it's natural interface with JavaScript, enables the team to
          build technology with confidence.

          `Zomby <http://zombyapp.com/>`_ is a massively multiplayer,
          location-based zombie apocalypse game. It was developed by
          Kudzu Creative Group. We chose MongoDB for our server
          primarily because of the ease of scalability. As our user-
          base expands globally, we will need to have multiple servers
          around the world, and MongoDB (and Erlang) will allow us to
          do that with minimal headache. Furthermore, due to the
          location-based nature of our game, we make extensive use of
          MongoDBs geospatial queries, which are both convenient and
          efficient.
