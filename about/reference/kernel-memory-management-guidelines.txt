Kernel Memory Management Guidelines
===================================

- Avoid using bare pointers for dynamically allocated objects. Prefer
  ``scoped_ptr``, ``shared_ptr``, or another RAII class such as ``BSONObj``.

- Do not use auto_ptr's and refactor legacy ones out whenever possible.
  (Careful with C++ driver and backward compatibility though.)

- If you assign the output of ``new/malloc()`` directly to a bare
  pointer you should document where it gets deleted/freed, who owns it
  along the way, and how exception safety is ensured. If you cannot
  answer all three questions then you probably have a leak.
