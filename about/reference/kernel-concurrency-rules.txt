Kernel Concurrency Rules
========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

All concurrency classes must be placed under ``utils/concurrency``. You
will find several helper libraries there.

- Do not add mutexes without discussion with others. Concurrency and
  correctness is very hard in the large. Great care is required. For
  example the concurrency model in replica sets is hard to understand
  and error prone (at least it was initially and probably still is). 

If you think there is a real need for an exception to the list below
let's have the group weigh in and get a consensus on the exception:

- Do not use/add recursive locks.

- Do not use rwlocks.

- Always acquire locks in a consistent order. In fact, the
  ``MutexDebugger`` can assist with verification of this.
  ``MutexDebugger`` is on for ``_DEBUG`` builds and will alert if locks
  are taken in opposing orders during the run.
