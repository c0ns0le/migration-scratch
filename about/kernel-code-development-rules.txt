Kernel Code Development Rules
=============================

C++ Style Guide
---------------

Coding conventions for the MongoDB C++ code:

- :ref:`Code Review <code+reviews>`

- :ref:`Kernel class rules <kernel-class-rules>`

- :ref:`Kernel code style <kernel-code-style>`

- :ref:`Kernel concurrency rules <kernel-concurrency-rules>`

- :ref:`Kernel exception architecture <kernel-exception-architecture>`

- :ref:`Kernel logging rules <kernel-logging-rules>`

- :ref:`Kernel string manipulation <kernel-string-manipulation>`

- :ref:`Kernel memory management guidelines <kernel-memory-management-guidelines>`

- :ref:`Writing tests for kernel code <writing-tests-for-kernel-code>`

For anything not mentioned here, default to `google c++ style guide
<http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml>`_.

JS Style Guide
--------------

10gen follows the `google javascript style guide
<http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml>`_.

Git Committing and Pushing
--------------------------

- Commit messages should have the case in the message SERVER-XXX.

- Commit messages should be descriptive enough that a glance can tell
  the basics.

- Commits should only include 1 thought.

- Do *NOT* push until running the :ref:`test suite <smoke-tests>`.

User Facing Conventions 
------------------------

.. warning::

   These are very important as we can't change them easily -- Much more
   than code conventions!

Anything users see -- command line options, command names, command
output, we need to think hard and carefully about the name to be used,
and the exact format and consistency of the items output. For example,
``serverStatus`` output is a bit of a mismash of lowercase and camelCase.
Let's fix that over time, starting with new things.

Anything user facing must be run by several team members first.

.. important::

   - Do NOT add a new $operator without signoff by the entire team.

   - Do NOT add a new command without signoff by the entire team.

Use camelCase for About Everything
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``--commandLineOptions``

- ``{ commandNames : 1, commandOption : "abc" }``

- Names of fields in objects we generate - such as command responses,
  profiler fields.

Include units in fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In things like ``serverStatus``, include the units in the stat name if
there is any chance of ambiguity. For example:

- ``writtenMB``

- ``timeMs``

We should have standards for these -- i.e. megabytes should always be
``MB`` and not ``Mb`` and ``Megabytes`` in different places. So the
standards are:

- For bytes: use ``MB`` and show in megabytes unless you know it will be
  tiny. Note you can use a float so ``0.1MB`` is fine to show.

- For time: use millis (``Ms``) for time by default. You can also use
  Secs and a float for times you know will be very long.

- For microseconds, use ``Micros`` as the suffix, e.g., ``timeMicros``.
